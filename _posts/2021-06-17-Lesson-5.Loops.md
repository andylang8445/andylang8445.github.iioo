# Loops
* Loops are used to repeat the sets of code repeatedly

# Different Types of Loops
There are multiple types to perform loop operation in C. There are numerous ways to perform this, but we will be discussing the three major types.

1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do while loop

## for loop
This is the most common method of performing the loop. You can use this type of loop to perform un-terminated loop (meaning the loop will not end) or loop that will repeat for certain amount of times. The basic form of the for loop look like:

```c
for([initialize];[loop condition];[command that will be performed each repeat]){
  Code that will be repeated each time;
}

The example code of this would be:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
  for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
    printf("%d",i);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This for loop will have ***i*** as a indicating variable. ***i*** will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. Next, the for loop will continuously check if the loop condirtion is true.If not, the for loop will be terminated. Lastly, for each repeat, the value of ***i*** will be increased by 1 every repeat.
