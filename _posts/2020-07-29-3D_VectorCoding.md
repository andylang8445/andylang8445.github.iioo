# Overview
* The goal of this project is to create the program that provides relationship between two vectors in 3D(R3 Plane)

# Planing
## Functions
* Multiple types of input type
* Determine if two vectors are equal, parallel or has POI in common
* Calculate the angle between two 3D vectors

## Pseudocode
