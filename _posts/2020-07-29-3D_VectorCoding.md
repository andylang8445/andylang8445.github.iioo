# Overview
* The goal of this project is to create the program that provides relationship between two vectors in 3D(R3 Plane)

# Planing
## Functions
* Multiple types of input type
* Determine if two vectors are equal, parallel or has POI in common
* Calculate the angle between two 3D vectors

## Pseudocode
<pre>
1. Start Program
2. Ask the user to choose the form of vector input
3. Get input(vectors) from the user based on the choice they made
4. Convert the vectors to point-form vectors
5. Calculate the angle between vectors and relationship between two vectors
6. Display the result
7. End program
</pre>

<br>The project was done from <b>25th of July</b> to <b>28th of July</b> in 2020

# What I learned from this Project
* Using multiple layers of data structures
* Creating a standard formula which can be useful for calculating 3D vectors
