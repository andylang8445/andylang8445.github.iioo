* Description of projects I have done so far and ongoing project

# Logic Gate Project
<a href="https://andylang8445.github.io/timecapsule/LogicGate">Proposal</a>

## What this is/Goal
* This is the project to create a platform specified for online programming education
* The main targetted audience is first year university students that does not have nay/minimal experience
* A web-based mentor-mentee matching as well as problem solving platform

## Current Status
* The architecture is being developed and some algorithms are still being discussed
* Encription method, overall design, and key experiences are determined
* Informational webpage is developed, and platform is slowly being developed as a reactive web

## What to be done
* Matching algorithm is being designed
* Database structure should be designed
* Additional security features should be added, avoiding recent security leaks (Heartbleed, Log4j, Hash collision and more)
* All sensetive informations will be encripted multiple times using SHA3 and SHA2-512 to ensure maximum security
