# Overview
* Exploring the concept of array in C/C++

# Array
* Array is used for representing number of variables with identical variable type esily.
* For example, when we need 100 integer values to be stored, we can simply say
```c
int arr[100];
```
instead of
```c
int a1, a2, ... ,a100;
```
* Also it is possible to compine for loops with arrays to make programming easier.
* Basically, array is a set of same-typed variables.

# Using Array with for loop
* It is possible to access the array element using another variable:
```c
int arr[5]={1,4,3,5,9};
int n=1;
printf("%d\n",arr[0]); //this will print 1
printf("%d\n",arr[n]); //this will print 4
```
