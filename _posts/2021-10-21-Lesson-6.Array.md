# Warning!

# Overview
* Exploring the concept of array in C/C++

# Array
* Array is used for representing number of variables with identical variable type esily.
* For example, when we need 100 integer values to be stored, we can simply say
```c
int arr[100];
```
instead of
```c
int a1, a2, ... ,a100;
```
* Also it is possible to compine for loops with arrays to make programming easier.
* Basically, array is a set of same-typed variables.
* Arrays can be made using all types of data types - int, float, double, long, unsigned, char, and more.

# Using array with for loop
* It is possible to access the array element using another variable:
```c
int arr[5]={1,4,3,5,9};
int n=1;
printf("%d\n",arr[0]); //this will print 1
printf("%d\n",arr[n]); //this will print 4
```
* Using the similar method, getting input from the user can be easier:
```c
int arr[5];
for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
    scanf("%d",&array[i]); //this will allow the user to inpur 5 integers seperated with a single space or a return button.
}
for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
    printf("%d ",arr[i]);//this will print the 5 integers that user have inputed seperated with a single space.
}
```
* Using this, you can build program easier and efficiently.

# Multi-dimensional array
* Arrays can be made in different dimensions.
* The following code will create a 2D array and get input from user
```c
int arr[5][5];
for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
    for(int j=0;j<5;j++){
        scanf("%d",&arr[i][j]);
    }
}
```
* The code above allows the users to input data in 2D form. For example:
```
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 7
9 5 3 6 2
1 3 5 7 9
0 65 3 2 6
```
* This type of input is possible.
* You can also create 3D and more dimensions to the array to increase the efficiency of managing datas stored in a array.
