# Overview
* Write the program that can get inputs from the users and process them

# Before We Start

* This lesson would be relatively hard/long/boring but it is essential part for programming
* Most programs we use interact with us. By getting inputs from users, the programs will be able to perform things that are referring to the inputs.

## Importance of Choosing appropriate Variable Type

There are multiple types of variables that you can declare. It is important to use appropriate type of variable depending on the needs. You should not only worry about the lack of range, but also bytes required since there could be limitations in maximum memory capacity (such as IoT devices, some coding competitions, or more).

# Getting Inputs and Printing the values

## Usage of variables

Variables can be used in the program to store values of calculations, user's input, and more places where you need to store the value.

## Getting Inputs

There are multiple ways of getting input from the users in the program. Among all methods to get inputs, `scanf` function is widely used due to its simplicity.

## Sample Code #1

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a = 0;
  scanf("%d",&a);
  printf("The user have inputted %d",a);
  return 0;
}
```

This sample code will wait for user to input an integer value and store it in variable called `a`. After that, the program will print the value stored in a with the explaining text.

## Sample Code #2

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int a = 0, b = 0;
int main() {
  printf("Input two integers separated by a blank to perform an addition calculation:\n");
  scanf("%d %d",&a,&b);
  printf("%d + %d = %d",a,b,(a+b));
  return 0;
}
```

This sample code will take two integers separated by a space and store them in each variable `a` and `b`. After that, the program will show the calculation result using the printf function.

## Summary

Based on the given sample codes, it is evident to say we can declare the variable by stating 

> (keyword of the type) (variable name) = (variable initial value)

inside the code.

 Also, the declaration can be done outside of the main function, making it a global variable.

When using `scanf` function, you can store value using 

> scanf ("*(type format)*",&(variable name))

and similar form to get input for multiple variables.

# Processing the Datas

Most of the programs (or softwares) requires the datas to be processed to meet the users' needs. In order to achieve them, a method of performing calulations are required. To perform very complex calculations, external header file is needed. Programmers doesn't necessary remembers all of them, but looks them up from the documentation of C language (it can be found [here](https://devdocs.io/c/)). However, the simple calculations (four arithmetic operations) are natively supported.

| Calculation Symbol | example | What it does                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \*                 | c=a*b   | multiplies the value stored in two variables                 |
| +                  | c=a+b   | sums the value stored in two variables                       |
| -                  | c=a-b   | subtract the value stored in variable that comes after - symbol from the previous variable |
|                    | c=-a    | changes the sign of the variable (negative to positive or positive to negative) |
| /                  | c=a/b   | gets the quotient of the deviation calculation ( a devided by b) |
| %                  | c=a%b   | gets the remainder of the deviation calculation ( a devided by b) |

These are the very basic calculation symbols in C. More of them will be introduced in later uploads or online resoureces.

In C, it is important to store the calculated value in another variable. Otherwise, the calculation result will not be remaining in the memory, and will result in waste of computing power. To store a value in a variable, we use
