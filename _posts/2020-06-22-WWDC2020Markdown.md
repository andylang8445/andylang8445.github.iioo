## New Features
### New design for incomming calls
Incomming calls including the calls from third-party apps will now appear on the top of the screen like an general app notification.8
### App Library
The additional screen at the end of the screens organizes all the instaled apps automatically by using folders and on-device intelligence. Users can also turn off the other app screens and keep only one page. The apps that are not reachable can be access from search.
### Widgets on Home Screen
The widgets comes with variety of sizes. Users can add widgets by entering Edit Home Screen mode. There is a special widget called <b>Smart Stack</b>. Smart Stack is like a folder for widgets that users can swipe on the widgets to transfer from one to another. It also changes them automatically using on-device inteligence.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1X67EHH.jpg" title="Sample usage of PiP" width="50%">
Users can play videos wile using other apps. When the user presses the home button or swipe up to go to home screen, PiP will be enabled. Netflix on iPad already has similar thing, so if anyone is interested in using this function ahead without using a Beta software, can try it out.
### Translate App
The translation app focused on conversations, not only prases. This app can work fully offline to enhance privacy. It uses neural engine and on-device machine learning to provide the best result between any supported languages. Personally, the best part of the app is supporting Korean, since Apple seemed to not care South Korean markets and also, I can translate to other languages offline when I'm traveling other countries using my first language.
### Digital Carkeys
Apple added the digital car keys. It uses NFC to work, and it can fully replace the function of the carkeys. If you lose the digital carkey, they can be disabled via iCloud. It can be shared via iMessage with controlled access. Users can restrict driving profile. Apple is working on setting this to standards for digital carkeys. They are also using U1 chip included iPhone 11 series to give users ability to unlock the door and start the engine while their phones are not on the charging pad. For other iPhones that doesn't have U1 chip, the phone has to be on the charging pad to start the engine of the car.
### App Clips
App Clip is a small part of the app. It is a small-sized app (10MB or less) that can be instantly launched by tagging <b>NFC tags</b>, from <b>webpage using Safari</b>, <b>App Clip Code</b>, and in more ways. It does not require other apps to be pre-installed and it also supports Apple Pay for the payment method. It also uses Sign in with Apple, so users doesn't have to loggin to the app. From newly added App Library, users can launch recently used App Clips. It is also a easy way to discover new apps that users might be interested in.
## Updated Features

The new Siri UI does not launch as full-screen, but a small overlay on the screen. The result for the command also appears on the top of the screen.
### On-device dictation

## New Features

Note app now recognizes hand writting like an typed document. Users can select by word or line. iPad uses on-device machine learning for hand writting recognition. the hand writting detecter also converts phone number, addresses to appropreate data type so that users can easily use the information they have wrote.

It has become more similar to macOS's Spotlight. It also has become Universal Search as well. It can search basically everything on the iPad storage and on the web.
## Personal Thoughts
As Apple has announced the migration to ARM Architecture (Apple Silicon), they have used A12Z Chip for the prototype and runed full macOS on it. They also redesigned many of iPad Apps similar to macOS. I personally think apple will use Z serise of A Chips for future iPad Pro devices and Macs. Since Apple has been advertising their iPad Pros as their next computer, iPad Pros might come with two different forms. iPad Pro running custom macOS with many IO devices (They might introduce this as Apple's new entry level Mac device), and iPad Pro running custom iOS(iPad OS) with Apple pencil. Everyone will know that processers in iPad Pro is very powerful and already shows better performance than some x86 chips. They have also added ability to use their Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard directly with iPad OS. This might be totally wrong, but I think this is pretty much possible for Apple to do.

# AirPods Software
## Summary
Most of the updates were about AirPods Pro, but rest of the series also got some updates.
### Automatic Switching
AirPods will automatically connect to Apple device that the user is using, without the user maually reconnect them. For example, if a user finishes listenign to music on their iPhone and start watching a show on their iPad, AirPod will automaticaly disconnect from the iPhone and connect to iPad. If the iPhone starts ringing, AirPods will automatically connect to the iPhone again.
### Spatial audio for AirPods Pro
By using spatial ausio algorithm that Apple has developed, Users can experience the surrounding audio from their AirPods Pro(Movie theatre-like experience). It uses the accelerometer and gyroscope inside AirPods Pro to keep the direction of the sound fixed even if the user moves their head. It also consideres the movement of iPad or iPhone that the show is being played from, so the sound stays in sync. The point of this new technology is to keep the users in the middle of the action, whereever the user goes. Spatial audio will be able to work with contents that are encoded to <b>5.1</b>, <b>7.1</b> and <b>Dolby Atmos</b>.

# One More Thing
## Apple Silicon
### Summary
Apple has announced the <b>migration</b> from <b>Intel cpu</b> to ARM-based <b>Apple Silicon</b>. All previews of new macOS during WWDC2020 was running on A12Z based mac. They revived the software Rosetta 2 and binary called Universal 2. Rosetta 2 is the software that automatically translates existing Intel based programs to run on Apple Silicon and Universal 2 is the binary that runs on both Intel based Mac and Apple Silicon based Macs. The transition will take about two years.

### For Developers
Developers all over the world can apply for DTK(Developer Transition Kit) hardware on <a href="https://developer.apple.com">developer.apple.com</a> that has form of Mac mini, but runs on A12Z SoC with 16GB memory, 512GB SSD, and macOS Big Sur devoper beta + Xcode. Apple will be shipping the units this week(week of June 22nd, 2020).

### For General Users
Apple's first Mac with Apple Silicon will be shipped out by end of this year(2020). They will still support and release the new macOS(s) for next few years, but eventually macOS will fully migrate to Apple Silicon and stop the supports for Intel Macs like they did when they migrated from PowerPC to Intel.
