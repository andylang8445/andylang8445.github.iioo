# One More Thing
## Apple Silicon
### Summary
Apple has announced the <b>migration</b> from <b>Intel cpu</b> to ARM-based <b>Apple Silicon</b>. All previews of new macOS during WWDC2020 was running on A12Z based mac. They revived the software Rosetta 2 and binary called Universal 2. Rosetta 2 is the software that automatically translates existing Intel based programs to run on Apple Silicon and Universal 2 is the binary that runs on both Intel based Mac and Apple Silicon based Macs. The transition will take about two years.
### For Developers
Developers all over the world can apply for DTK(Developer Transition Kit) hardware on <a href="https://developer.apple.com">developer.apple.com</a> that has form of Mac mini, but runs on A12Z SoC with 16GB memory, 512GB SSD, and macOS Big Sur devoper beta + Xcode. Apple will be shipping the units this week(week of June 22nd, 2020).
### For General Users
Apple's first Mac with Apple Silicon will be shipped out by end of this year(2020). They will still support and release the new macOS(s) for next few years, but eventually macOS will fully migrate to Apple Silicon and stop the supports for Intel Macs like they did when they migrated from PowerPC to Intel.
