## New Features
### App Library

### Widgets on Home Screen

Users can play videos wile using other apps. When the user presses the home button or swipe up to go to home screen, PiP will be enabled. Netflix on iPad already has similar thing, so if anyone is interested in using this function ahead without using a Beta software, can try it out.
### Translate App
The translation app focused on conversations, not only prases. This app can work fully offline to enhance privacy. It uses neural engine and on-device machine learning to provide the best result between any supported languages. Personally, the best part of the app is supporting Korean, since Apple seemed to not care South Korean markets and also, I can translate to other languages offline when I'm traveling other countries using my first language.
### Digital Carkeys
Apple added the digital car keys. It uses NFC to work, and it can fully replace the function of the carkeys. If you lose the digital carkey, they can be disabled via iCloud. It can be shared via iMessage with controlled access. Users can restrict driving profile. Apple is working on setting this to standards for digital carkeys. They are also using U1 chip included iPhone 11 series to give users ability to unlock the door and start the engine while their phones are not on the charging pad. For other iPhones that doesn't have U1 chip, the phone has to be on the charging pad to start the engine of the car.
### App Clips
App Clip is a small part of the app. It is a small-sized app (10MB or less) that can be instantly launched by tagging <b>NFC tags</b>, from <b>webpage using Safari</b>, <b>App Clip Code</b>, and in more ways. It does not require other apps to be pre-installed and it also supports Apple Pay for the payment method. It also uses Sign in with Apple, so users doesn't have to loggin to the app. From newly added App Library, users can launch recently used App Clips. It is also a easy way to discover new apps that users might be interested in.

# AirPods Software
## Summary
Most of the updates were about AirPods Pro, but rest of the series also got some updates.
### Automatic Switching
AirPods will automatically connect to Apple device that the user is using, without the user maually reconnect them. For example, if a user finishes listenign to music on their iPhone and start watching a show on their iPad, AirPod will automaticaly disconnect from the iPhone and connect to iPad. If the iPhone starts ringing, AirPods will automatically connect to the iPhone again.
### Spatial audio for AirPods Pro
By using spatial ausio algorithm that Apple has developed, Users can experience the surrounding audio from their AirPods Pro(Movie theatre-like experience). It uses the accelerometer and gyroscope inside AirPods Pro to keep the direction of the sound fixed even if the user moves their head. It also consideres the movement of iPad or iPhone that the show is being played from, so the sound stays in sync. The point of this new technology is to keep the users in the middle of the action, whereever the user goes. Spatial audio will be able to work with contents that are encoded to <b>5.1</b>, <b>7.1</b> and <b>Dolby Atmos</b>.
