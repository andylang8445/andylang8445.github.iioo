# Overview
* Write your first C/C++ Program

# Before we start
I will be using Xcode 12.4 on macOS 11.2.3, running on intel-based MacBook Pro 13 inch 2019. Due to the odd nature of visual studio's C compiler, some codes might not work on them. I highly recommend using online IDE using gcc compiler.

# Start to code
## Launch Xcode
When you launch Xcode, you will see the screen like this:

## Create a new Xcode project
When you press on "Create a new Xcode project", you will be asked to choose the type of the project. There is an option called "Command Line Tool" under macOS tab.

After that, name your new project and put Organization Identifier you want (I have it as "Personal").

## Start coding
