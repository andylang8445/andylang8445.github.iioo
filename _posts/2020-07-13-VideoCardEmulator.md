# Overview
* The goal of this project is to create a emulation software for Video Card

# Planning
## Goal of the project
The ultimate goal of this project is being able to emulate the video card from scratch (from creation of pulse generator to displaying the image file)

# Programming

# Problems, Bugs and Errors
## Identifier
### 10MHz Pulse Generator
<b>Problem ID: 2020071501</b><br>
For this project, 10MHz pulse generator is needed for setting the correct timing of display rate. However, 10MHz Generator that I built has small delays. Since each pulse has to be generated by every 100 nano second, small delays are reasonable sources of potential problems.

## Ideas to resolve problems
### 10MHz Pulse Generator
<b>Problem ID: 2020071501</b><br>
One possible solution for 10MHz P.G. problem is using multi-thread processing. Multi-thread processing is the method that allows multiple processes to run on the same time. By using this, We can process multiple tasks for each pulse much faster and efficiently.
