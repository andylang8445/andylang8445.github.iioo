# Overview
* Coding is an effective way to communicate with computing devices

# Coding and Programming
## Definition from Dictionary
* Coding: [noun] the process of assigning a code to something for the purposes of classification or identification.
* Programming: [noun] the action or process of writing computer programs.
## So, what's the difference?
* Coding is basically indicating the process of typing the programming languages to write a software.
* Programming is the whole process of the software development, from designing the structures of a software to finding and fixing bugs after the coding process.

# How to make computers do stuff
## Coding
* Coding is basically writing a document with the instructions that the computer should follow.
* What really happens behind the scene:
<pre>
1. A programmer writes code in programming language (with proper grammar for that specific programming language)
2. The programmer compiles or run the program he/she wrote
3. Computer (IDE) checks if there is any errors, warnings, or potential errors in the code.
  - If so, the computer refuses to run the program and stopes the process
4. Programming language (generally in a relatively <b>high-level</b> form so that programmer can understand easier) gets translated to machine code (The language that computer can understand)
5. The program gets loaded to RAM (Random Access Memory, which has about 8~32GB capacity in typical computers nowadays)
7. CPU (sometimes GPU) runs the program and constantly interact with RAM during the process
8. When the program is terminated, stopped working due to the errors, or finished the work assigned CPU stops the program and offload the datas from RAM so it can work on the new task
</pre>
* It seems pretty complicated, but only things that matters to you(learning the basic level of programming)
<pre>
1. Choose appropriate IDE and programming language for the purpose
2. Always read the error messages or warning signs appear on the screen
3. If you think that you did everything write, press compile(or run) on the IDE to order you computer to run your program
</pre>


# So, what are you going to teach me?
## Basic outline
0. Introduction to Coding/Programming
1. What do I need to start Programming?
2. What are difficulties that most people face?
3. Getting Input and Displaying something
4. Making program to do things differently in different conditions
5. Repeating things
6. Quiz
7. Can I make my code simpler?
8. Introduction to algorithm
More things will be determined in the future

# Code Example
## Sample Code 1
<div>
<a onclick = "this.nextSibling.style.display=(this.nextSibling.style.display=='none')?'block':'none';" href = "javascript:void(0)">
<b>View Code</b>
</a><div style = "DISPLAY : none">
<script src="https://gist.github.com/andylang8445/af9ee066867631a1bc02cbe8b73493ee.js"></script>
</div>
</div>
## Sample Code 2
<div>
<a onclick = "this.nextSibling.style.display=(this.nextSibling.style.display=='none')?'block':'none';" href = "javascript:void(0)">
<b>View Code</b>
</a><div style = "DISPLAY : none">
<script src="https://gist.github.com/andylang8445/bb6da1b47954f05d75449bc5f9b2c912.js"></script>
</div>
</div>
<br>The project was done from <b>25th of July</b> to <b>28th of July</b> in 2020
