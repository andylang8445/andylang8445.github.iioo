# Overview
* Write the program that can get inputs from the users and process them

# Before We Start

* This lesson would be relatively hard/long/boring but it is essential part for programming
* Most programs we use interact with us. By getting inputs from users, the programs will be able to perform things that are referring to the inputs.
