# Desiure for making decisions

Making decision is an ordinary thing for a person to do in one's typical day; from deciding what to wear to a life-changing decisions. For a program, this is also an essesncial piece to have. In this lesson, we will learn how a decision making is done.

# Different types of decision making

There are several ways to make a decision in C. We will explore some of common ways to do so.

## if stastement

An `if` statement is a most common way to make decision. you can use `if` statement by:

```c
if(condition){
  Do something
}
else if(condition){
  Do something
}
else{
  Do something
}
```

The `condition` in the brackets should return `true` as its result in order for the operation to be executed under that `if` statement.

### Conditions

In C, there are numeroius ways to write a condition. Before makeing any further statements, you should know how to compare the values.

| Operation | Example        | Explanation                                                  |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ==        | A==B           | Checks if vale of A is equal to B. If the statement is true, this will return `true` and this will return `false` when A and B values does not match. |
| !=        | A!=B           | If A has a different value from B, this will return `true` and will return `false` when A and B has the same value |
| >         | A>B            | This returns `true` when A value is larger than B, and returns `false` when B is larger or equal to A |
| <         | A<B            | This returns `true` when A value is smaller than B, and returns `false` when B is smaller or equal to A |
| >=        | A>=B           | This returns `true` when A value is larger or equal to B, and returns `false` when B is larger than A |
| <=        | A<=B           | This returns `true` when A value is smaller or equal to B, and returns `false` when B is larger than A |
| &&        | (A<B)&&(A<C)   | This will return `true` if the first  and second condition are **both** true. If one of the conditions are false, this whole condition would return `fasle`. In this example, A has to be smaller than both B and C to make this statement true. |
| \|\|      | (A<B)\|\|(A<C) | This will return `true` if one of the first and second condition is true. If both of the conditions are false, this whole condition would return `fasle`. In this example, A should be smaller than B **or** C to makie this statement true. |

### else if and else statements

With If and else statements, we can use else if and else statements. For each if statements, you can add infinite numbers of `else if` statements. `else if` statement checks the conditions similar to
