# Problem Analysis
## Sound Problems
The sound from the right speaker sounded like it's been compressed, and eventually stopped working.
## Keyboard Problems
Some keys from the keyboard(butterfly mechanism 3) wasn't working correctly. (Double input or not inputting anything)
# Process of Repairment
## Drop-off
I dropped my MacBook Pro at Apple Certified Service Centre on <b>June 15th, 2020</b><br>
The technician said it will take about <b>7-9 business days</b>
## Problem analyzed by technician

More comments as he worked on my device:

Mac Resource Inspector - all pass.
Attempted normal startup - unit powers on, loads to user’s operating system.
Distorted audio from right speaker.
Internal inspection - debris stuck to speaker.
Cleaned speaker.
Issue persists.
```
## Processing
After that, he called me and asked if I can turn off "Find My Mac".<br>This are the comments left on that after the conversation:
```
3:41:00pm on 6/30/2020
Topcase with keyboard and speaker is attached.
Need to replace topcase with keyboard,
would take 5-10 business days for part to arrive and be installed.
Find My Mac is enabled, needs to be turned off before we can order parts.
Called customer
	- customer removed Find My Mac by erasing computer,
	- agreed to turnaround time.
```
```
10:50:05am on 7/10/2020
Replacement topcase arrived, started install.
```
<br>
While that, I had to use my iPad for all the homework from school, classes and tutoring.

## Done
```
11:24:23am on 7/10/2020
Completed install.
```
# After everything is done
## Feeling
After all these things, I was really happy to get my Computer fixed in this COVID-19 Situation.<br>
However, I was disappointed a bit with the timing of the repairment.<br>
I went to this place instead of Apple Store because they were simply not open by the time I needed my MacBook fixed. But they have reopened on June 25th, and they would have got my MacBook fixed on the day I dropped it off, or the day after.<br>
Still, my MacBook was under warranty from Apple since I have purchased mine on end of August, 2019. So all the replacement was free.<br>
I'm glad that I was able to get my MacBook fixed after all.
